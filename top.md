# i2p.plugins.tor-updater

A Tor package updater and runner as an I2P Plugin. This plugin is
usable on Windows, Linux, and OSX, as is the freestanding binary.
This also functions as a freestanding update for the Tor Browser
Bundle and is capable of configuring Tor Browser from the terminal
and updating it without running it, should the user choose to operate
this way.

This project explicitly views I2P and Tor as complementary privacy
tools and explores good ways of combining them in a user-facing tool.
It is especially useful when combined with a SOCKS Outproxy plugin
like the one written by zzz. You can obtain it within I2P: http://zzz.i2p/topics/3219

Usage:
------

See [Usage](USAGE.md) for command-line usage. When used from the Terminal,
it acts as a cross-platform Tor Browser installer and wrapper, which adds
non-Tor specific options.

Router Agnosticity Plan
=======================

 * **Rule 1:** Don't make people configure stuff
 * **Rule 2:** Don't sacrifice features

That means:

***detect, detect, detect.*** Detect when it's a Java router and when it's a C++ router. Detect
when an API is available or when it isn't. Detect sound configuration in the absence of user
directives.

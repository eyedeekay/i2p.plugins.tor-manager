Hello from I2P, OnionSpace! Thought I'd try to do something we'd both enjoy
===========================================================================

This `.onion` site corresponds to an I2P user who is helping to distribute
the Tor Browser bundle in a somewhat unique way. These users have downloaded
the Tor Browser for their platform, and they have chosen to share it over
I2P, using both the I2P Web and I2P Bittorrent. The goal is twofold, to provide
a large number of ad-hoc mirrors of the latest offical Tor Browser Bundle, and
provide a means for I2P users to download and configure the Tor Browser without
initially retrieving Tor over the clearnet.

I2P is another anonymous network, it works slightly differently than Tor, it's
designed in such a way that every router in the network is also a relay. This
has advantages and disadvantages, which is why we try to encourage people to
consider I2P and Tor separate, complementary, and not necessarily competitive
tools. I2P can be quite good at distributing Tor and Tor Browser, and Tor Browser
can be an effective tool for browsing I2P.

At last, an I2P Browser you might want to use
=============================================

1. I2P can only grow if it's easily accessible to people
2. I2P and Tor have different, unique strengths and can be more powerful when combined in a considered way
3. Anonymity is a collaborative effort
4. Leeching is rude, if we use something we should try to improve it or give something back
